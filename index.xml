      <title>Are your maps meaningless to 8% of your audience?</title>

&lt;p&gt;We are visual beings, which is why we engage so quickly with pictures. As the use of info graphics increases, it is important to stick to simple rules, like using colourblind friendly palettes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are innately visual creatures. If you want confirmation of this in our industry, see what happens next time you’re in a long, exhausting meeting. As soon as someone pulls out a map or an image of some sort, people perk up. Conversations become more animated and decisions are made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love photos, images, maps and, at a pinch, charts. Its why graphics are significantly more effective (and increasingly popular) at communicating information than large tables of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another fact about our biology, though, is that not all of us can see colour. While it seems disadvantageous to navigating in a world bursting with bright hues, about 8% of the population (mostly males) have some kind of colourblindness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has implications for mapping. When we learn how to map, we are taught basic techniques about colour, composition and detail. We need to remind ourselves regularly how we can make minor changes that will improve the meaning for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some great resources about how to make your maps and charts ‘colour blind friendly’ can be found at &lt;a href=&#34;http://colorbrewer2.org/&#34;&gt;Color Brewer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dtpli.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/227445/Communicating-Data-With-Colour.pdf&#34;&gt;Victorian State Government&lt;/a&gt;. QGIS, the free open source GIS, also has colourblind simulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the following maps. They plot the probable impact of job automation across Greater Sydney (in all cases, red indicates a higher probability).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first map shows a common method for displaying variables: a red to green palette. The reds and greens in the map are essentially indistinguishable from each other for most colourblind people, rendering the map illegible. The other two maps show a more appropriate palette choice – red to blue, or shades of a single colour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not that hard to improve accessibility in maps. And as we map more and more of our world and our lives, it’s crucial to be inclusive of all vision types. Feel free to contact us at &lt;a href=&#34;https://geografia-au.github.io/&#34;&gt;Geografia&lt;/a&gt; if you want to know more about this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Evaluation of the economic and social impact of a three year grants program designed to&amp;nbsp;stimulate private&amp;nbsp;investment and create jobs&amp;nbsp;in the World Heritage listed port city of George Town. We surveyed applicants and the wider business community to measure the success of the funding in meeting program objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Knowledge Jobs in Melbourne&#39;s SE</title>
      <link>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/knowledge-jobs-in-melbourne-s-se/</link>

      <guid>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/knowledge-jobs-in-melbourne-s-se/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Together with regular collaborator, Tim Nott, we investigated how to leverage from existing knowledge-based industries and supply chain components in eastern metropolitan Melbourne. The work formed part of a wider strategy designed to increase jobs in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/rockingham-community-development-plan/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive 10 year&amp;nbsp;community infrastructure plan. Our revenue estimation model ensured&amp;nbsp;affordable implementation&amp;nbsp;for the City. Follow up work included the preparation of a brief for an economic development plan and a community centre feasibility study.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Boroondara Arts and Cultural Strategy</title>
      <link>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/boroondara-arts-and-cultural-strategy/</link>

      <guid>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/boroondara-arts-and-cultural-strategy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Introducing evidence-based analysis into arts participation and demand, we developed an arts and cultural strategy that emphasised the development of new and existing arts clusters to ensure the enthusiastic participants of Boroondara had access to a range of arts and cultural activities and facilities. This map below&amp;nbsp;was one of our earliest mapping efforts to identify spatial gaps in service delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alkimos Eglinton Population Projections and Facility and Services Needs Assessment</title>
      <link>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/alkimos-eglinton-population-projections-and-facility-and-services-needs-assessment/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 07:59:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/alkimos-eglinton-population-projections-and-facility-and-services-needs-assessment/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We ran population forecasts for the 2,100ha Alkimos Eglinton subdivision using a cellular automata method to populate the land through small contiguous cells. Then we used these figures to prepare a community infrastructure plan with staged rollout of schools and other community facilities over the development cycle of the new suburb.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Binningup Demographic Profile and Infrastructure Need Assessment</title>
      <link>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/binningup-demographic-profile-and-infrastructure-need-assessment/</link>

      <guid>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/binningup-demographic-profile-and-infrastructure-need-assessment/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By analysing the geography, history, demography and governance of 60 coastal towns around Australia, we found strong evidence for consistent trends that helped us to model the likely demographic change and infrastructure need for fast growing Binningup, south of Perth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Maddington Kenwick Education and Training Services Profile</title>
      <link>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/maddington-kenwick-education-and-training-services-profile/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 07:32:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/maddington-kenwick-education-and-training-services-profile/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This study made recommendations for improvements to the focus and delivery of education related support programs for the region. The gap analysis was enhanced with a 10-year industry level labour market demand scenario model. GIS was used to map accessibility to education facilities for a community that was significantly transport disadvantaged.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Value of Manufacturing in South East Melbourne</title>
      <link>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/value-of-manufacturing-in-south-east-melbourne/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 07:02:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/value-of-manufacturing-in-south-east-melbourne/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Accurately documenting the size and value of&amp;nbsp;manufacturing in a particular region is both difficult and useful. In south east Melbourne we found its 71,300 workers generated almost $7.9 billion in GRP. This is 24% of the State&amp;rsquo;s manufacturing value and almost 7% of national manufacturing GDP. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Economic Impact of Arts Venues in Melbourne</title>
      <link>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/economic-impact-of-arts-venues-in-melbourne/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 06:31:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/economic-impact-of-arts-venues-in-melbourne/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project measured the economic value of artists living and working in the City of Melbourne, focusing on the effect of arts spaces. We found we could use GIS and the City&amp;rsquo;s extensive database to measure the &amp;lsquo;gentrification effect&amp;rsquo;; the flow-on benefits of arts spaces on neighbourhoods over time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An analysis of the City&amp;rsquo;s comparative advantages in water-intensive manufacturing. The project highlighted good prospects for food and beverage manufacturing, which benefits from a number of other local advantages including&amp;nbsp;low water and other input&amp;nbsp;costs; access to a&amp;nbsp;skilled workforce; and a good logistics network.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
