If we accept that our economy is complex and never in equilibrium, then we need to keep an eye out for both small and large changes in it. You can never tell which one&nbsp;might become a defining influence on what our job landscape and our cities look like. <br><br>In the case of <b>automation, </b>a lot has been written on it already. We've been going through waves of job automation for at least a few centuries now, although the one we're at the beginning of just might be one of the fastest we've ever experienced. Here in Australia a greater proportion of the population work; so more people want jobs, but automation could be removing them at a faster rate than they are replaced. <br><br>There are spatial implications to this. Here is a map of Greater Sydney. It shows place of residence data for all workers. The areas in&nbsp;red are where,&nbsp;according to current research, there is a higher probability of jobs being automated over the next few decades (go to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/atlas">www.geografia.com.au/atlas</a>&nbsp;to see a similar map for Greater Melbourne). &nbsp;<br><br><img alt="Thumb automation small" src="/img/blog/large_Automation_small.png" class="wysiwyg-float-left"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Obviously the outer suburbs already face significant challenges in accessing jobs and services. The pace at which job destruction runs relative to job creation in the outer suburbs&nbsp;is another important issue to address.<br><br>One of the ways in which it is already being addressed is through <b>job atomisation</b>, or the shift to what is&nbsp;known as the&nbsp;on-demand economy. Task-oriented, part-time and casual work are all increasing as a share of total employment. We've recently interviewed some Melbourne-based on-demand workers. They are all educated, ambitious and, by all accounts, doing well.&nbsp;Some of us might be forced down this pathway,&nbsp;but the people we spoke to&nbsp;all made a choice to pursue this less&nbsp;certain&nbsp;career trajectory. They say it&nbsp;allows them to integrate work into their private lives and&nbsp;get paid for work across&nbsp;a variety of fields. They embrace co-working spaces more than business incubators, want more public transport and better access to High Speed Broadband.&nbsp;<br><br>It appears that&nbsp;the creative classes we've been reading about for over a decade now, might finally be evolving into&nbsp;this form. The trick for us as economic and urban&nbsp;planners is to work out how to incorporate on-demand workers into our modelling and analysis. For example:<br><br><ul><li>How&nbsp;are we going to map commute patterns for someone who has three jobs? Where is their place of work?&nbsp;</li><li>In which municipality do we record their contribution to Gross Regional Product?&nbsp;</li><li>Will the on-demand economy counterbalance the agglomeration of jobs into the CBD? If the worker is more mobile, do they need to commute into the City everyday? For that matter, robots probably don't need to either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>A lot of the generic economic and population modelling tools we have are very unlikely to be up to the job of quantifying this more atomised economic landscape.&nbsp;Its an interesting area to investigate and we're working on it.&nbsp;<br>
