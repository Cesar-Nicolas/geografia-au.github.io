<div>Normal job distribution around our capital cities shows extreme concentrations in the city centres, with an outward&nbsp;spread of clusters usually located around major infrastructure (e.g. roads, hospitals, industrial areas). Encouraging the growth of jobs in some of the outlying clusters is an important strategic planning objective as it can improve job accessibility for outer suburban residents and spread the transport load around the city.</div><div><br></div><div>A considerable amount is known about&nbsp;how these clusters emerge; whether there are underlying patterns to their formation; and how much&nbsp;influence can be applied to these patterns. The research we did on the knowledge economy reminded us that Melbourne’s metropolitan job clusters appear to fit a predictable hierarchical pattern based on size. It’s a fairly familiar pattern, with one variation of it known colloquially as the 80:20 rule: where 80% of something is accounted for by 20% of the whole. While those ratios are not the specific pattern we found, it’s part of the same family.</div><div><br></div><div>Using Census data on job location we mapped where jobs were located and where the clusters appeared (see attached map - the red indicates job clusters using a 2km threshold).<br><br></div><br><img alt="Thumb prelim   2000m clusters" src="/img/blog/large_Prelim_-_2000m_clusters.png" class="wysiwyg-float-left"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><div>To tell whether the clusters fit our pattern, we plotted them on a chart. When transformed a certain way, they should follow a straight line, and they do (see attached chart). In fact a lot of economic phenomena conform to this pattern. So this in itself should not be surprising.</div><br><br><br><img alt="Thumb test plot1" src="/img/blog/large_Test_Plot1.png"><br><br><br><div><div>But what does it mean? It means that job clustering, or the concentration in numbers of jobs across a metropolitan area, is being influenced by a set of economic factors that, ultimately, create a relatively predictable pattern. If this pattern is resilient, then it tells us something about which clusters will be easier to grow. Anything above the line is going to be a challenge and anything below the line may be easier.<br><br>The plot below shows the retail sector for these same clusters. There are&nbsp;outliers in this plot, which&nbsp;suggests we may need to work a little more on defining the clusters. Nonetheless, there is still a very&nbsp;obvious linear relationship here, which&nbsp;demonstrates a strong size&nbsp;hierarchy. This makes sense, given what we know about how the&nbsp;retail sector is spatially distributed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br><img alt="Thumb retail cluster plot" src="/img/blog/large_Retail_Cluster_Plot.png" class="wysiwyg-float-left"><br><br><br></div><div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>These complex relationships are likely to be caused by a combination of&nbsp;different factors such as distance, land suitability, history and so forth. Irrespective of the cause,&nbsp;the size of job clusters do appear to fit this well-established pattern. This clearly affords us&nbsp;a clue about how to prioritise metropolitan growth strategies.&nbsp;Additionally, with cheaper and more readily available data analysis, we can do this more efficiently and make a really cost effective and valuable contribution to policy making. Our next step is to start examining what might be the dominant drivers.&nbsp;</div></div>
