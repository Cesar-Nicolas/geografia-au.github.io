<div>The Greater Bunbury area (150km south of Perth) has a population of 75,000 and is forecast to grow to 100,000 by 2031 and 150,000 by 2050. A review of land supply by the State planning authority concluded that demand could be satisfied through a combination of an urban infill program and the release of over 2,000ha of land for Greenfield development. At first glance this seemed plausible. However, a closer examination revealed some fundamental flaws in the underlying assumptions that would have resulted in a land shortage of between 300 and 1,000ha.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The State Government’s population and housing capacity assumptions included the claims that every dwelling will be occupied by 2.5 people; that dwellings will always be 100% occupied; and that there will be no holiday homes or short term accommodation in the region. Most importantly, it also assumed housing densities could reach inner metropolitan levels within a few years, predicated on a population ageing rate that contradicts the population projections for the region, which emphasise the relatively young age of new residents. Together these assumptions allowed up to 75,000 new residents to be accommodated through some infill and the release of a little over 2,000ha of land.&nbsp;<br><br>We took a look at housing development trends around Australia, including population densities and how they have changed. From this we developed a model to predict the most likely population and housing density given the regional setting. This was based on an analysis of data over 12,000 small area sites around Australia. We found we could group regional areas into different density clusters and that Bunbury sat in ‘Group 4’, already one of the more densely developed regional cities. In order to accommodate new residents into the land set aside within the regional growth strategy, Bunbury would have to ‘step up’ to group 6; something that was unprecedented in the historical data (see chart). &nbsp;<br></div><div><br><img alt="Thumb bunbury article 1" src="/img/blog/medium_Bunbury_article_1.jpg" class="wysiwyg-float-left"><br><br><div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Dwelling and population density are the result of dynamic processes with multiple interactions and feedbacks between dwelling type, household structure, income, proximity to employment hubs, amenity, land prices and occupancy rates. The non-linear relationships between these factors make it critical that strategic planning draws on models that are sophisticated enough to measure them and provide plausible scenarios for growth. For example, the relationship between dwelling density and household size varies with densely developed areas attracting a mix of non-family households with small households and large group houses. Locations with good amenity also have a high proportion of holiday homes and/or temporary tourism accommodation, which reduces the proportion of permanent residents. Multilevel apartments also attract rental investors which means more transient populations and higher vacancy rates.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The bottom line was that the State Planning Authority’s land demand estimate was between 360ha and 1,000ha short of what will be required to accommodate the projected population.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The application of maximum dwelling yields multiplied by an average household size for all dwelling types and locations does not account for the dynamic way in which population, proximity, amenity and dwelling density interact. Oversimplified population calculations coupled with a mismatch between density targets and the reality of housing choices (as shown in the Census data) has the potential create housing shortages and increase housing prices. Application of a more sophisticated technique that draws on real world data can overcome these problems.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br></div><div><span class="wysiwyg-color-silver">"Bunbury 03" by Bmorey at the English language Wikipedia.
