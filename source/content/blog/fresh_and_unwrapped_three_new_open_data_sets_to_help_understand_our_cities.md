<div>As advocates of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data">open data</a> initiatives, we're pleased to discover three freshly released data sets available to planners and economists seeking to understand Victoria's cities. Gaining access to these data sets is hugely important for planning and managing cities. Congratulations to the government departments responsible for compiling and releasing these important data sets - the open data movement is gaining momentum!</div><b><br></b><div><b>1. Detailed commercial, industrial and residential floor space data<br><br><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://cdb.io/1AyR701 "><img alt="Thumb image2" src="/img/blog/medium_image2.jpg"></a><br></b></div><br><div><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ga.gov.au">Geoscience Australia</a> has worked hard to collect and distribute&nbsp;floor space data for industrial, commercial and residential uses at a small area (SA1) level across Australia. This is the first time (in our knowledge) that floor space data has been released at such a fine grain level. Until now, analysts have relied on very&nbsp;coarse geographical data, such as ABS destination zones or SA2s. These coarse geographies don't capture the intricacies of localised&nbsp;land use differences.&nbsp;GA's data set can be used to&nbsp;measure the spatial distribution of key land uses across the city, or&nbsp;act as a proxy measure for building heights, employment, and job density.</div><b><br></b><div><ul><li>Interactive map of industrial areas in Melbourne:&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://cdb.io/1AyR701">http://cdb.io/1AyR701</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Source data:<b>&nbsp;</b><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/hazards/risk-impact/nexis">http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/hazards/risk-impact/nexis</a></li></ul></div><b><br></b><div><b>2.
