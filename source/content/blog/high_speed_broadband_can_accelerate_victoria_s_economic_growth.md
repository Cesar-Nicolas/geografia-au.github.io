<div>Our recent study for Southern Melbourne RDA looked into the economic benefits of the NBN and included a survey of over 300 businesses in the region.&nbsp;These businesses were in precincts that were not included in the current NBN rollout plan.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The survey examined the quality of the current Internet access in the precincts; the effect this was having on business productivity and growth; and the expected benefits that high speed broadband (HSB – in this case, the NBN) would bring to their business.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Amongst many results, the study found that HSB was expected to deliver increased productivity, expansion into new manufacturing and even the reshoring of more traditional manufacturing. It also concluded that the scale of these benefits would vary depending on the type of business and its market focus.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The enterprises most likely to gain from HSB were:&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; •	High value (measured by turnover); large employers;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; •	Export oriented businesses; and&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; •	Larger manufacturing, construction and wholesaling enterprises.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In the short term, these HSB-related gains are presumed to be driven by two major trends:</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. The increasing integration of international markets and intensive use of information technologies. This is placing pressure on businesses to adopt new programs and communications tools and is particularly relevant to exporters.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.	The shift from traditional, production-based manufacturing towards a service-orientation. That is, advanced and high-value manufacturing are increasingly run as service consultancy-based enterprises, heavily reliant on complex information exchange.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Obviously, then, the NBN has a clear impact on Victoria’s economic growth trajectory. Moreover, if these survey results reflect businesses across the metropolitan area, then we can map ‘HSB-responsive’ industries and, in doing so, point to where the NBN can and should be prioritised to optimise the economic benefits (see maps below). Providing NBN in these locations has the potential to significantly accelerate Victoria’s economic growth, particularly in the highly important advanced manufacturing sector.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As businesses are far more willing to be early adopters of HSB than households, prioritising these clusters over residential areas can fast track both NBN take-up and economic growth: a win-win for Victoria and NBN Co.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Figure 1 &nbsp; The Ideal NBN Priority Hotspots<br><img alt="Thumb impact of nbn map 1" src="/img/blog/Impact_of_NBN_Map_1.jpg" class="wysiwyg-float-left"></b><b><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Figure 2 &nbsp; The Ideal Advanced Manufacturing&nbsp;NBN Priority Hotspots</b><br><img alt="Thumb impact of nbn map 2" src="/img/blog/Impact_of_NBN_Map_2.jpg" class="wysiwyg-float-left"><br><br></div>
