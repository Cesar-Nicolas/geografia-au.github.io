    title: "Population modelling, analysis and forecasting"
    desc: "The world is full of interactions, ranging from simple to dynamic and complex. Many, if not all, affect how communities grow and change. The population modelling and forecasting we carry out describe how our populations might look in years to come and the policies and investments that will be most suited to support them."
  - icon: "random"
    title: "Scenario planning"
    desc: "Scenario planning, also called scenario thinking or analysis, is a strategic planning method used to make flexible long-term plans by asking 'what-if' questions."

    title: "Infrastructure supply-demand modelling"
    desc: "Infrastructures provide the foundation for economic vitality, security and every day comforts. Through modelling we help identify gaps in supply, predict long-term demand and assist in the planning and provisioning of infrastructure."
  - icon: "home"
    title: "Housing demand analysis"
    desc: "Often working in collaboration with planners and urban designers, we apply modelling techniques to describe, explain, and predict patterns of price, supply of, and demand for, residential housing by dwelling type, household structure. The analysis informs the preparation of housing strategies."

    title: "Stakeholder engagement"
    desc: "Our IAP2 (International Association for Public Participation) trained team help our clients work with community industry and government stakeholders through dialogue that teases out the social, environmental and economic issues that matter most."
  - icon: "laptop"
    title: "Online decision support tools"
    desc: "We work with clients to develop mobile and web-based decision support tools and expert systems to help them be more effective decision-makers. These tools integrate both qualitative and quantitative dimensions to the decision making."

services_economics:
  - icon: "bar-chart"
    title: "Economic modelling and analysis"
    desc: "Given the enormous complexity of economic processes we develop models that estimate and forecast economic activity, which can be used to design and test policy, investment planning and risk management."
  - icon: "building-o"
    title: "Labour market analysis"
    desc: "Our models look at the suppliers of labour services (workers), the demands for labour services (employers), and helps explain the patterns of employment and the opportunities it might present in regions around Australia."
  - icon: "money"
    title: "Economic impact and cost benefit"
    desc: "We help clients measure or estimate the change in economic activity in a specified region, caused by a change in business or policy circumstances. The study region can be a neighbourhood, town, city, county, statistical area, state, country, continent, or the entire globe and the results are used for business cases, what-if analysis and other studies."
  - icon: "laptop"
    title: "Economic development and digital strategies"
    desc: "We prepare readable and achievable regional or industry-based economic development strategies. As economic activity moves into the digital realm, we are increasingly, turning to digital economy strategies, helping clients to take advantage of the digital economy."
  - icon: "map-marker"
    title: "Interactive atlases"
    desc: "We develop online atlases to help visualise and communicate the results of modelling and analysis. Spatial economic data is dynamic and deep. Rather than presenting this in static maps and tables, we prefer to compile interactive, online atlases for clients to explore and understand their economies in as much detail as they wish."
  - icon: "lightbulb-o"
    title: "Knowledge economy research"
    desc: "The emergence of knowledge-intense employment, where it agglomerates and why has been an area of research of ours for over a decade. More recently, we see that technology and, in particular, Artificial Intelligence is transforming a part of human knowledge to machines. This knowledge can be used in various fields and generate economic value. We are helping clients understand the impact of technology to their work."

services_geodata_analytics:
  - icon: "compass"
    title: "Spatial Statistics and machine learning"
    desc: "We help clients understand how location impacts their work. To do this we apply the latest techniques from the fields of Statistics and Machine Learning."
  - icon: "building-o"
    title: "Service demand modelling"
    desc: "Using geospatial, demographic and economic data we help clients predict how demand for goods and services varies over time and geography and, therefore, how they can plan and locate their service provision to maximise efficiency and equity."
  - icon: "map-marker"
    title: "Computational geography"
    desc: "We apply the latest techniques in computation science to geographic problems to help clients make better decisions in planning, development and service provision."
  - icon: "cubes"
    title: "Geodata visualisation"
    desc: "We have a strong focus on data visualisation and its ability to communicate patterns across space and time."
  - icon: "image"
    title: "Land use analysis"
    desc: "We build models to forecast infrastructure demand so clients can decide on the most optimal infrastructure locations, the best use of funds and good policies that will address supply gaps."
  - icon: "building"
    title: "Infrastructure needs assessment"
    desc: "We build models to forecast infrastructure demand so clients can decide on the most optimal infrastructure locations, use of funds or policy to fill gaps in supply."
  - icon: "book"
    title: "Survey data and collection"
    desc: "We design and build data collection tools which can incorporate geographic location, thus bringing the spatial dimension to decision making."
