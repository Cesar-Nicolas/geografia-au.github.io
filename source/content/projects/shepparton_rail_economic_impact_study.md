One of the first times&nbsp;Geografia used a systems analysis approach to assist in regional economic planning, we developed a model to&nbsp;measure the economic impact of improved passenger rail services to Shepparton. The work was based on a large-scale survey of regional residents which allowed us to value the benefits of being able to regularly commute to and from Melbourne. It highlighted the flow-on benefits of better passenger rail services linking incremental improvements to increase in passenger numbers by type of journey. We followed up this work with an examination of Shepparton's main pedestrian mall and the relative costs and benefits of reopening it to vehicle traffic.&nbsp;<br><br><span class="wysiwyg-color-silver">Image: freight train</span><br><br><br>
