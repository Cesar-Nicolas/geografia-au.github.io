This project analysed&nbsp;significant demographic differences between alternative proposals in the Western Australian&nbsp;metropolitan local government boundary reform process. It included GIS and statistical analysis, as well as 35 year&nbsp;population projections for each new municipal configuration. The work informed the decision-making of the Western Australian&nbsp;Local Government Advisory Board in its recommendations to Government about preferred amalgamations.&nbsp;<br><br><span class="wysiwyg-color-silver">Image: Metropolitan population projections (Geografia, 2014)</span><br><br>
