As part of a review of the population growth assumptions underpinning the Greater Bunbury Strategy, we deployed our housing and population capacity model to estimate the land required to accommodate expected population growth in the Greater Bunbury Region. We found that the increase in density was likely&nbsp;be slower than expected and that this would result in a&nbsp;shortfall of up to 700ha of residential land by build out.&nbsp;<br><br>As with all forecasting we do, we used a probabilistic model to account for the uncertainty in the population growth and other key factors such as household size, dwelling choice,&nbsp;vacancy rates and rate of construction.&nbsp;<br><br><br><span class="wysiwyg-color-silver">Image: Bunbury ocean view</span><br><br>
