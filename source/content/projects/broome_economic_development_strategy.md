Landcorp, the Shire of Broome and the Kimberley Development Commission worked with Geografia to profile and investigate the Shire's economic state of play&nbsp;and its prospects for growth in light of global and regional conditions.&nbsp;To ensure Broome becomes&nbsp;the region's 'supertown' required strategic decision-making informed by&nbsp;consultation, data analysis, population and economic forecasting. This charted a trajectory for Broome that would balance mining services, tourism and agribusiness.&nbsp;<br><br><span class="wysiwyg-color-silver">Image: Broome economic regions (Geografia, 2014)</span>
