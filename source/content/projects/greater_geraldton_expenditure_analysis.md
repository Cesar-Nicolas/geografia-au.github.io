Working with Landcorp, the MidWest Development Commission and the City of Greater Geraldton, we quantified business, government and consumer expenditure leakage from the region. For consumer leakage, we used real expenditure data sourced from Quantium. The outcome included the identification of supply chain opportunities for new business enterprises in the region.
