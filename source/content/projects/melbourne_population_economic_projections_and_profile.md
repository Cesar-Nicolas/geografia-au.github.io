Geografia provides both demographic and economic projections and profiling for the City of Melbourne. We employ what is referred to as a Monte Carlo modelling technique to calculate ranged estimates for the Cityâ€™s population by suburb to 2036. Both the population and economic figures are on websites custom designed by Geografia for the City. We work with leading Australian demographer, Dr Tom Wilson to ensure the figures are based on the latest, most reliable projection methodologies.
