<span>A study into the infrastructure and economic issues and opportunities for Preston Beach, south of Perth. A follow up study made recommendations on town development based on an analysis of 60 small coastal towns around Australia. We also went on to conduct a similar analysis of the small coastal community of Binningup. The work consolidated our understanding of how Australian coastal towns develop along characteristic trajectories dependent on their history, geography, governance and infrastructure.<br><br><span class="wysiwyg-color-silver">Image: Coastal town development trajectory (Geografia, 2009)</span></span>
