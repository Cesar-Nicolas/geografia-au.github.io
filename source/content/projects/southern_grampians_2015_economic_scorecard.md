This project pioneered our use of dynamic systems modelling for local government; evaluating the prospects of important regional propulsive industries to stimulate employment and population growth. Since then, Geografia has completed several more projects for the Shire on population analysis; industry growth plans; and economic impact assessments on proposals relating to the regional airport livestock exchange and road transport issues.
