We completed three of the seven components of the Liveable Cities' Greater Launceston Plan (a 20 year part Commonwealth-funded land use plan). First off was the community statement; a thorough documentation of community profiles across the six municipalities that made up the region.

Part two - the resource analysis - included population, housing and employment modelling designed to map out different growth scenarios and land use suitability. This included the range of probable growth, employment and housing trends into the modelling.

Finally the community vision was developed in consultation with the residents and businesses, using the information gathered to inform their thinking on where they wanted the region to be in 20 years.
