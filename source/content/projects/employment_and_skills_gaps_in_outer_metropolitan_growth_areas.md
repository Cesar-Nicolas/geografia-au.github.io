  <span>Working
  with Melbourne firm, Essential Economics, we undertook a study into the
  economic conditions and prospects for the 25 councils that make up the
  National Growth Areas Alliance. Geografia developed a jobs and skills deficit
  measure that plotted each council according to whether their priority
  concerns were a lack of jobs, skills or both. The current trajectory for each
  council was also plotted. A strategy for intervention was prepared. Its
  foundation was the creation of skills ecosystems that would target 20,000
  more jobs in two years.<br><br><span class="wysiwyg-color-silver">Image: Employment rates NSW growth areas (Geografia, 2012)</span></span></span>
