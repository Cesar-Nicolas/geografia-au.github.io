<div><span class="wysiwyg-color-gray">We introduced the concept of systems modelling to local economic issues by developing a model that would measure the benefits of different development scenarios around the Stockman mine site in the Tambo Valley. The modelâ€™s results (and report) were used by the Shire to negotiate community development contributions from the company. The systems approach to modelling was used to construct a community decision support tool for the Shire. This was used at a highly successful community workshop focusing on how best to replace the Raymond Island Ferry service. An inter-industry impact model and capital works model were also developed for the Shire.</span><br><br><span class="wysiwyg-color-silver">Image: Tambo Valley communities influence diagram</span><br></div><div><br><br></div>
