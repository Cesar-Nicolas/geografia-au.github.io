In partnership with the Orbost community, we have developed a plan for the economic revitalisation of Orbost and surrounds. The plan addresses the effect of industry changes, particularly forestry, and the declining population. It includes business cases for key revitalisation initiatives, such as&nbsp;Orbost as an aged friendly town, tourism opportunities and agribusiness&nbsp;and is based on substantial community input.&nbsp;<br><br><span class="wysiwyg-color-silver">Image: "Marshall's Commonwealth Hotel Orbost" by Nomad Tales from Australia - Marshall's Commonwealth Hotel Uploaded by Mattinbgn.
