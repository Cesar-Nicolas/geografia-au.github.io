Working with Melbourne firm Planisphere, the study examined 31 Victorian towns, all with fewer than a thousand residents, and explored their changing nature and the contributions they make in regional Victoria. As part of the case studies, we undertook economic and demographic modelling, geographic information system (GIS) and consultation. The project outcomes supported the State Governmentâ€™s regional growth plans.
