A regional economic development research exercise commissioned by UrbanGrowth NSW. This project identified growth opportunities for central Newcastle. The aim was to find ways in which the City could use its competitive advantages, particularly in agribusiness, tourism and existing assets, to diversify its economy and bring more jobs and residents back to the down town&nbsp;area.&nbsp;<br><br><span class="wysiwyg-color-silver">Image: Newcastle central area (Geografia, 2014)</span>
