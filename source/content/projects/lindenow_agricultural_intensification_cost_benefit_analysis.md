Our land use optimisation model was used to predict land use change in response to greater water security in the Lindenow Valley in East Gippsland. This model identifies the thresholds at which land can be turned over to commercial crops. Improved water security then becomes the catalyst for investment, an increase in employment and, subsequently, local population. The module factors in rainfall, water availability and other production costs and outputs are farm gate sales, regional multipliers, the impact on population growth and likely demand for essential services.
