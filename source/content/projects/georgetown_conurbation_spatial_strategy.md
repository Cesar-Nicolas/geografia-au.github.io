<span>The Malaysian Federal Government, through Think City commissioned Geografia to research and prepare a spatial strategy for Northern Malaysia. Encompassing land use planning, economic and demographic analysis, we prepared a 20 point plan for making strategic land use planning decisions that would assist with national development goals. The first plan was prepared in 2009 and we updated it in 2014. Amongst other things, we&nbsp;examined and modelled&nbsp;economic development opportunities in manufacturing, agribusiness, tourism, hi tech R&amp;D and services.&nbsp;<br><br><span class="wysiwyg-color-silver">Image: Economic interactions in Northern Malaysia (Geografia, 2013)</span></span>
