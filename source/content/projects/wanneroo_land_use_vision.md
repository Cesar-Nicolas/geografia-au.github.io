A 50 year strategic vision to guide the City onto a more sustainable pathway. After detailed demographic and economic analysis we worked with the City and residents to prepare a strategic plan for land development, transport and community infrastruture planning that would help the City move closer towards the City envisaged its residents and businesses. After its conclusion, we went on to undertake a public open space study and several smaller projects investigating the options for the redevelopment of specific Council facilities.
