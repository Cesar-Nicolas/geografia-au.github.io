A study mapping and analysing the potential scale and nature of employment growth in the Brimbank National Employment Cluster. It involved extensive economic modelling and GIS analysis to determine three likely growth scenarios for the Cluster and the net employment gain that the Cluster could accommodate as it expands.&nbsp;<br><br>We incorporated uncertainty into the modelling by composing probability ranges for key decisions (e.g. to invest in new transport infrastructure) and processes (e.g. the probability that a new infrastructure investment would attract new office activity).&nbsp;<br><br><br><span class="wysiwyg-color-silver">Image: Brimbank transport network (Geografia, 2014)</span><br>
