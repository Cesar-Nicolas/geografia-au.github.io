      <description>&lt;p&gt;We ran population forecasts for the 2,100ha Alkimos Eglinton subdivision using a cellular automata method to populate the land through small contiguous cells. Then we used these figures to prepare a community infrastructure plan with staged rollout of schools and other community facilities over the development cycle of the new suburb.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/court-demand-modelling-across-victoria/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A multi-jurisdictional service demand model to estimate future court activity across 50 regions around Victoria. It uses probabilistic (Monte Carlo) modelling to factor in uncertainty around demand, demographic, technology and policy changes and informs GHD&amp;rsquo;s service plan for Court Services Victoria.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>School Site Optimisation in Greater Brisbane</title>
      <link>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/school-site-optimisation-in-greater-brisbane/</link>

      <guid>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/school-site-optimisation-in-greater-brisbane/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from the work in Moreton Bay, we further developed the school demand forecasting technique to determine whether a proposed new school site would minimise school catchment area overlaps in a region with a rapidly growing population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>School Demand Forecasting in Moreton Bay</title>
      <link>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/school-demand-forecasting-in-moreton-bay/</link>

      <guid>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/school-demand-forecasting-in-moreton-bay/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A statistical and GIS-based analysis of school demand to identify the optimum site for a new school in Moreton Bay on behalf of Brisbane Catholic Education (BCE). It uses&amp;nbsp;real enrolment data, analysing trends over time to develop a probabilistic model of the growth rates for new catchment areas. This factors in travel patterns and &amp;lsquo;attractiveness&amp;rsquo; features to identify the better of two locations for a new school in the rapidly growing region. We then adapted and applied the model to assist BCE in determining the viability of a new primary/secondary school in a neighbouring region, factoring in the existing school provision, population growth and the likelihood that the new school would attract a sufficient number of new enrollees to warrant the investment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Employment and Skills Gaps in Outer Metropolitan Growth Areas</title>
      <link>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/employment-and-skills-gaps-in-outer-metropolitan-growth-areas/</link>

      <guid>https://geografia-au.github.io/projects/employment-and-skills-gaps-in-outer-metropolitan-growth-areas/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Working
  with Melbourne firm, Essential Economics, we undertook a study into the
  economic conditions and prospects for the 25 councils that make up the
  National Growth Areas Alliance. Geografia developed a jobs and skills deficit
  measure that plotted each council according to whether their priority
  concerns were a lack of jobs, skills or both. The current trajectory for each
  council was also plotted. A strategy for intervention was prepared. Its
  foundation was the creation of skills ecosystems that would target 20,000
  more jobs in two years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;wysiwyg-color-silver&#34;&gt;Image: Employment rates NSW growth areas (Geografia, 2012)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
