# Making changes

1. All changes are to be made in the `source` directory. Don't touch files outside that directory, as they are automatically generated.
2. If you are making changes to HTML you are doing it *WRONG*

All changes must be done in the `source` directory see [source](https://github.com/geografia-au/geografia-au.github.io/tree/master/source)  you donâ€™t need to touch anything else. and even in there most changes will be under the `data` directory [data](https://github.com/geografia-au/geografia-au.github.io/tree/master/source/data) If you see yourself changing HTML you are doing it wrong. Please contact myself or @ziprandom before  making HTML changes.

So as an example this [issue 44](https://github.com/geografia-au/geografia-au.github.io/issues/44)  required a change to our achievements, the data for which is under the `data/milestones` directory [source/data/milestones](https://github.com/geografia-au/geografia-au.github.io/tree/master/source/data/milestones)

In the beginning you may need to try to figure out the `source` directory layout. But it's not too complex.
